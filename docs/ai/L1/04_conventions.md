> Coding patterns shared across `server/` and `web/`. Follow these to keep local and deployed modes aligned.

## Boundary ownership

- Browser code calls only `/api/*`. Backend placement is hidden behind Next rewrites (`web/next.config.ts`).
- **Never** add `web/app/api/**/route.ts` for agent/token logic — `verify-api-contracts.ts` fails the build if a `route.ts` appears under `app/api`.
- Token generation and the App Certificate stay in `server/`.

## Backend (Python / FastAPI)

- Async throughout: route handlers are `async def`; the agent uses `AsyncAgora` and `create_async_session`.
- Request bodies are Pydantic models (`StartAgentRequest`, `StopAgentRequest`). Field names are **camelCase** (`channelName`, `rtcUid`, `userUid`) to match the browser client.
- Error mapping is centralized: `_to_http_error()` maps `ValueError → 400`, `RuntimeError → 500`, else 500. `_log_route_error()` logs with safe context + traceback. Raise plain `ValueError`/`RuntimeError`; let the route convert.
- Logging via `logging.getLogger("uvicorn.error")`.
- Env read with `os.getenv`; `.env.local` then `.env` loaded with `override=True`.

## Response envelope

All backend JSON responses use:

```json
{ "code": 0, "msg": "success", "data": { } }
```

`data` is present only when the route returns a payload. The browser client treats `code !== 0` (or missing `data`) as an error.

## Filler-words and farewell config

- Both configs are built in `filler_config.py` as **pure functions** (`build_filler_words()`, `build_farewell()`), not inline in `agent.py`. This makes them independently testable.
- `build_filler_words()` uses `mode: "static"` — the only mode supported by SDK 2.0.0. Do not set another mode.
- `farewell_config` is embedded in the `parameters` dict passed to `AgoraAgent(...)`, not as a top-level argument.
- Edit `FILLER_PHRASES` in `filler_config.py` to customise the phrase list.

## Cascading vendor wiring

The pipeline is assembled in `Agent.start()` via method chaining:

```python
agora_agent.with_stt(stt).with_llm(llm).with_tts(tts)
```

`turn_detection` (VAD) is set directly on `AgoraAgent(...)` as a top-level argument — unlike the MLLM recipe where it is vendor-owned.

## Web (TypeScript / Next.js)

- Lint/format with Biome (`bun run lint`, `bun run lint:fix` in `web/`).
- RTC client creation must be StrictMode-safe (strict mode is on).
- Transcript speaker mapping uses real UIDs (`normalizeTranscript` maps `uid === '0'` to the local UID); do not heuristically guess speakers.
- API client lives in `src/services/api.ts`; UI never calls `fetch` to the backend directly.

## Testing approach

- Backend: `pytest` in `server/`, standalone — `conftest.py` fakes env and SDK session, so no cloud or real creds are needed.
- `test_filler_config.py` imports `filler_config` directly (no `agora_agent` import needed) — pure function tests.
- Web: contract/proxy/fastapi smoke scripts under `web/scripts/` run without live Agora calls.
- Run the **narrowest** relevant verify command before finishing (see [05_workflows](05_workflows.md)).

## Doc upkeep

When you change request/response contracts, env vars, or workflow, update the web client, backend, contract checks, README, **and** the matching `docs/ai/L1/` file together, then bump `Last Reviewed` in [L0](../L0_repo_card.md).
